What is Cloud ?

Cloud is a large virtual space of storage device where you can store a large type of data and run softwares and also access various services of the data. This allows users to access data anywhere with an internet connection

What is Cloud Computing ?
Cloud computing is a technology model that involves the delivery of computing services over the internet. Instead of owning and maintaining physical servers and infrastructure, users can access and use computing resources,applications,and storage   
Public Cloud:Public cloud It's like using apps, storing files, or doing tasks on the internet that anyone can access.     Example: Think of Google Drive or Amazon Web Services (AWS).
Private Cloud:  Private Cloud It's like a digital clubhouse where only you and your team have access. Others can't just drop in.it is own personal, private computer space     Example: A company using its own server for all its digital needs.
   Hybrid Cloud:  It's like having your private computer space, but sometimes you use the shared internet space too.
Example: A business storing sensitive data in its private space but using the public cloud for extra storage or specific tasks.
Regions
Regions in cloud computing refer to geographic locations where cloud providers have data centers. Each region contains multiple data centers.
Availability Zones
Availability Zones are isolated locations within a region that have their own power, cooling, and networking. They are designed to provide high availability and fault tolerance.
Scalability
Scalability is the ability of a system to handle an increasing amount of work or its potential to be enlarged to accommodate that growth.
Elasticity
Elasticity in cloud computing refers to the ability to dynamically scale resources up or down based on demand.
Agility
Agility is the capability of quickly and easily adapting to changes. In the context of cloud computing, it involves the rapid deployment of resources and applications.
High Availability
High Availability (HA) ensures that a system or application is operational and accessible for a high percentage of time, typically 99.9% or higher.
Fault Tolerance
Fault Tolerance is the ability of a system to continue operating without interruption in the presence of hardware or software failures.
Disaster Recovery
Disaster Recovery involves the planning and processes for restoring and recovering data and systems after a natural or human-induced disaster.
Load Balancing
Load Balancing is the distribution of network traffic or computing workload across multiple servers to ensure no single server is overwhelmed.

Vocabulary in cloud computing
Virtualization : virtualization is the process of creating virtual version of something such as operating system,or servers or storage devices or resources

Virtual machine : virtual machine is a software based emulation where you can run multiple operating system on a single physical machine

API (Application Programming Interface)
Api is a set of rules and protocols that allows software to communicate with each other. It defines how software components should work with each other.

Regions
Regions in cloud computing refer to geographic locations where cloud providers have data centers. Each region contains multiple data centers.
